Step 1:
	Connect to Palmetto
Step 2: 
	Install the latest version of Photoscan(1.4.1) to your user account or check to make sure you have the latest version installed
Step 3:
	Upload the following scripts to your user account and save them all to same directory and make note of the direct path to that directory:
		initNetProcessing.sh
		initProcNode.sh
		initServerNode2.sh
		NetworkProcessingScript_V_1.py
		procNodeArray.sub
		submit.sh
		interact.sub
	#Note: All files are in the GIS libstorage under workflows/photoscan/finalNetworkScripts
	Upload your photos to their own folder and make sure only photos are in that folder and make note of the direct path to your directory containing that folder
Step 4:
	Upload arguments.txt to your default home directory on Palmetto:
		EX: /home/USERNAME
	DO NOT SAVE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE, IT MUST BE LOCATED HERE
Step 5:
	Open arguments.txt using nano or vim and follow its instructions, ensure that there are only 6 lines of text and no spaces in between them
# IF YOU WISH TO HAVE THE AGISOFT NETWORK MONITOR GUI OPEN TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF YOUR PROJECT
# FOLLOW STEP 6, IF NOT SKIP AHEAD TO STEP 8
Step 6: 
	Open a second window in SSH and switch to your directory we made note of in Step 3
	then run the command: 
		qsub interact.sub
Step 7:
	After the interactive session has started switch to your PhotoScan installation directory
	then run the command:
		./monitor.sh
	Now go back to the first ssh window (should still be on the login node of palmetto)
Step 8:
	Switch to the directory we made note of in step 3
	then run the command:
		./initNetProcessing.sh
	## IF YOU SETUP THE AGISOFT NETWORK MONITOR ##
		this script will print out the IP address of the photoscan server node to the console
		copy that IP address into the IP address box in the Agisoft network monitor GUI and select connect
