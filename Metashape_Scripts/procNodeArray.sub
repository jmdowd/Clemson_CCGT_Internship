## This is an example job array script which will start 8 GPU nodes as Metashape processing nodes.
## The hardware requirements above are very effective for large processing jobs (100's+ photos).
## Refer to the Palmetto documentation for details on selecting hardware (www.palmetto.clemson.edu)
# ** Edited on March 27, 2019 by Justin Dowd, CCGT Senior GIS Intern **
# ** Edit was to allow scripts to run Metashape instead of PhotoScan, Metashape is the newer version of PhotoScan released by Agisoft **


## CHANGE TO YOUR DIRECTORY CONTAINING initProcNode.sh ##
networkPath=`sed -n '6 p' ~/arguments.txt`

# Initialize as a Metashape processing node.
cd $networkPath
./initProcNode.sh
